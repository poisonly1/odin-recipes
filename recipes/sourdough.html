    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A basic sourdough recipe that makes a simple unflavored loaf. Once this is mastered, you can begin experimenting with all sorts of additions!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1000g Bread Flour</li>
        <li>200g Sourdough Starter</li>
        <li>750g Water</li>
        <li>22g Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First, you'll want to feed your sourdough starter. There's many ways to do this, see notes at the end for instructions.</li>
        <li>Once starter is well fed, combine with water. Whisk with dough whisk until combined, bubbly, and milky.</li>
        <li>Combine flour and salt with starter and water mixture. Mix until a homogenous shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 1 hr covered with a dish towel or loose plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Stretch and fold dough until it no longer readily stretches. Rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Repeat stretch and folds 3 more times, resting 30 minutes between each</li>
        <li>Turn out dough onto counter -- should peel away relatively cleanly from bowl. Split into 2 loaves.</li>
        <li>Spread dough out into a flat rectangle, then fold sides in and roll up into a ball. Repeat with second loaf.</li>
        <li>Start rolling dough into a taught ball, using a hook shaped movement to round it out and create a taught smooth top. Repeat with second loaf.</li>
        <li>Put dough ball into banneton or lined bowl and cover. Leave in fridge for 8-16 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to bake, preheat oven to 450F with container inside [I prefer a dutch oven].</li>
        <li>Once oven is heated, put dough into dough sling and score about a centimeter deep. Put in container and bake covered for 23 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 23 minutes, reduce oven temperature to 400 and remove lid. Set timer for 22 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sourdough is complete! Let cool COMPLETELY before cutting.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p>Feeding sourdough can be done many different ways -- this is my preferred method, but feel free to use your own!</p>
    <l>
        <li>Take sourdough from fridge -- if an abundant amount, remove down to about 100g.</li>
        <li>Add 100g warm water and mix until frothy and well combined.</li>
        <li>Add 100g of all purpose flour. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Leave in warm area anywhere from 2-6 hrs depending on last feed.</li>
        <li>Starter is ready when doubled in size.</li>
    </ul>
